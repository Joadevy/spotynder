## Overview
swiperify is an app that allows you to find your next favorite song to add to your playlist. The name swiperify was born because it's a mix of Spotify and Tinder where users swipe right to add a song to their playlist, swipe left to skip, and discover another one. Users also can create new playlists & populate them with new music.   
Speaking of tech, It's Astro-based combined with React for client-side interactivity.
